                  <a href="https://heyanon.xyz">heyanon </a>
                  is a way for people who did cool stuff on Ethereum to
                  broadcast messages anonymously on Twitter. Historic moment
                  feeds are curated by the
                  <a href="https://twitter.com/heyanonxyz"> @heyanonxyz </a>
                  account, such as the{" "}
                  <a href="https://twitter.com/DAOHackGossip">DAO hack</a>
                  feed. Anyone whose participation in the moment can be verified
                  on-chain can post to the feed. The magic is that you donâ€™t
                  need to reveal your address when you do.

                <strong>How does it work?</strong>
                <div>
                  When you send a message with heyanon, you generate a
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof">
                    {" "}
                    zero-knowledge proof{" "}
                  </a>
                  that you were involved with a certain event on-chain. This
                  proof hides all information about your address. The proof is
                  all that is sent to the{" "}
                  <a href="https://heyanon.xyz">heyanon</a> backend for
                  verification. Upon verification, the proof is posted to
                  <a href="https://ipfs.io/">ipfs</a>
                  and your message is sent via the specified event feed bot. The
                  message has with it a verify link twitter readers can use to
                  the proof located on ipfs themselves. For more, check out our
                  github (TODO: add github).
